<p>There are a  few ways to work with dried chickpeas. But once you ve tried them &#8211; you ll never go back to tinned!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> </strong>Long soak and simmer, about 10 hours or overnight plus 2 hours</li>
<li> Quick soak and simmer, about 3 hours</li>
<li> In the Slow Cooker, 4 hours on high heat or 8 hours on low heat. Do a big batch and freeze as below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dried chickpeas will triple in size when cooked. So 1 cup of dried chickpeas will make about 3 cups of cooked chickpeas.</p>
<p>Once cooked cool completely and freeze in batches &#8211; remember to label and date &#8211; keeps for 3 months.</p>

Ecoffee cup small,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very few people know it, but 2017 marks a somewhat dubious 30th anniversary: that of the modern single-use “paper” cup. In three short decades, we estimate over 2 trillion of them have ended up in landfill – oh, in case you’re wondering, that’s 2,000,000,000,000.</p>
<p>The average lifespan of a single-use cup is 13 minutes – and due to their plastic content less than 1% get recycled.</p>
<p>So, in what could only be described as the understatement of the century, we felt there was an appetite for change! We passionately maintain that recycling is not the answer; instead, we can only institute real change with your help. In this enlightened era, there really is no excuse for single-use. That’s why we created Ecoffee Cup.</p>
","<p>Ecoffee Cup is a new generation of reusable takeaway cup. Created with the world’s fastest growing, most sustainable crop – bamboo fibre, Ecoffee Cup is BPA and phthalate free. If you haven’t experienced Ecoffee Cup, it feels a bit like thick, yet super-light cardboard; hard to believe it can hold hot liquids.</p>
<p>And because bamboo fibre is naturally sterile, Ecoffee Cup is lovely to drink from and won’t flavour-taint your drinks. The lid and sleeve are made with matte food-grade silicone which is designed especially for hot liquids.</p>
<p>It has a re-sealable no-drip lid, making it perfect to take with you everywhere you go. The whole product (cup, lid and sleeve) is dishwasher safe and should last for years if you treat it nicely; of course it can break if you treat it roughly and it is not suitable for microwave use.</p>
<p>Available in a wide range of fun, contemporary patterns; bright, vibrant colours or classic prints – there’s one to suit your style, wardrobe or mood. That’s why we think Ecoffee Cup packs just a little bit more style than its plastic, ceramic or stainless steel cousins.</p>
<p>Ecoffee Cup. Have Fun. Do Good.</p>

Konjac sponge,Pure,"<p>The Konjac potato or <i>Konnyaku</i> is a perennial plant native to Asia and can be found growing wild at very high altitudes. A totally natural food source, Konjac is 97% water, rich in mineral goodness and low in calories. The plant is naturally alkaline, which leaves skin perfectly balanced.</p>
<p>Konnyaku has been used in Korea, Japan and China for over 1,500 years as medicine, food, a dieting aid and a beauty product. Due to the plant&#8217;s claimed health giving properties, the Konjac Sponge was originally created for delicate baby skin.</p>
<p>We are proud to carry the Leaping Bunny and Vegan Society symbols as signs of our commitment to producing natural, cruelty free skin care. All our sponges are tested for authenticity and purity, However, many inferior products are often mass produced in poor quality, unethical factories and use low grade, unclean materials.</p>

Beauty balm vegan,Orange lavender frankincence,"<p>The <strong>Balancing Frankincense, Lavender and Orange Beauty Balm</strong> is a luxurious treat <wbr>&#8211; this can be used as an intensive moisturiser, as a cleanser or as a concentrating mask to be slathered on the skin for 15 mins and removed with a flannel.</p>
<p>Frankincense is thought to have anti-ageing properties and is a favourite in the beauty world for its youthful affect!</p>
<p>The healing properties of lavender are well documented &#8211; this is due to its anti oxidant and anti microbial benefits. This means it s perfect for hormonal break outs or when you need a skin pick me up after a late night.</p>
<p>The zesty orange essential oil complements the frankincense beautifully, making this the must have stunning treat for your skin. <wbr></p>
<p>The Luxury Beauty Balm with<em><strong> Rose geranium and Sweet Orange </strong></em>can be used in the same way as the Balancing Beauty Balm. It again smells amazingly fresh, with a slight rosey floral aroma.</p>
<p>Use it as an intensive moisturiser or for an rejuvenating facial mask. Cover the face with the balm and relax for 15 mins while the luxury balm goes to work. Maybe even read a book or even better meditate! Wipe off the redidual balm with a hot wet face cloth and enjoy.</p>
<p>Added to this oil cleansing is definitely all the rage at the moment in the natural beauty world. We ve just taken this a step further. The theory stems from the well known scientific fact that like attracts like. So when you use oil as a cleanser the sweet almond oil in the balm attracts and dissolves unwanted oils from the skin. But (and this is the important bit) it does not strip the skin of its natural defences through harsh chemicals and foaming agents. Wet your face with warm water &#8211; no soap. Aplly the balm gently with your fingertips and work in using small gentl circular movements and the wipe off with a hot wet face cloth. Leaving your skin feeling dewy and supple&#8230;..</p>
<p>Rose Geranium is believed to be great as a relaxing, hormone- balancing essential oil.</p>
<p>It has mood lifting properties and works really well to calm down irritated and inflamed skin. While the zesty <em><strong>Sweet Orange</strong></em> essential oil complements the <em><strong>Rose Geranium</strong></em> beautifully.</p>

<p>As always The Herb Garden&nbsp; products are suitably simple but luxuriously divine.</p>
<p>They have included the Calendula infused oil specifically for its gentle healing and anti inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Added to this they have&nbsp; incorporated Vit E oil which is a natural preservative - hence the long shelf life - as well as a powerful anti oxidant. Anti oxidants are known to assist in neutralising free radicals. Free radicals can be created by our bodies as we age, or by everyday factors like digestion or exercise. They’re also caused by exposure to external things like:</p>

Copper scourer,,"<p>Another fab product from Redecker</p>
<div>
<div class=""std"">
<p>Non-plastic durable scrubbers are very hard to find. You may still be able to find some steel wool ones but they rust easily and are not extremely durable &#8211; and can be very abrasive, damaging cookware. We found this one that is 100% copper.</p>
<p>It is durable and machine-washable (up to 60 degrees Celsius), and 100% recyclable. It cleans pots, pans, ovens, ceramic cooktops, glass, stainless steel&#8230;thoroughly and gently. Because copper is a soft metal that is non-abrasive, its fine copper threads loosen even the most stubborn dirt carefully.</p>
<p>Not recommended for non-stick pans. Please note that these scrubbers may scratch surfaces they are used on, but not nearly as readily as would steel wool. Comes as a set of 2.</p>
<p><strong>Dimensions:</strong></p>

Deo,Natural,,"<h5 class=""page-title"">Natural Organic Deodorant Ingredients</h5>
<div class=""rte"">
<p>The Earth Conscious Natural Deodorant is a totally natural deodorant made in the UK using natural organic ingredients.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>They do not use synthetic fragrances thus our scents are very subtle. Their ingredients are sourced from ethical suppliers with the majority&nbsp;certified by the <a title=""Soil Association"" href=""http://www.soilassociation.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Soil Association</a>. &nbsp;</div>
<p>Below you can find out more about the benefits of each ingredient they use and if you're interested in why they don't use others there is our <a title=""The Whys and Why Nots of our Natural Deodorant Ingredients"" href=""https://www.earthconscious.co.uk/blogs/the-earth-conscious-way"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Whys and Why Nots of our Natural Deodorant Ingredients.</a></p>
<p>Coconut Oil</p>
<p>A main ingredient in our natural deodorant. Coconut oil is not only incredibly soothing and softening to the skin it also has many health benefits. Coconut oil contains healthy fats that do wonders for the skin and body. It is also <strong>naturally antibacterial</strong> and <strong>anti-fungal</strong> so it’s really the perfect ingredient for a natural deodorant. Our coconut is high quality <strong>Soil Association certified organic</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Shea Butter</strong></p>
<p>Incredibly luxurious softening butter. Like our coconut oil, the shea butter we use is quality <strong>Soil Association certified organic</strong>. Shea butter also contains fatty acids and nutrients that work wonders for our skin and health.</p>
<p>Jojoba Wax</p>
<p>Jojoba is the most similar to human skin oil which makes it a great oil balancing ingredient.</p>
<p>Sunflower Wax</p>
<p>Sunflower wax is rich in Vitamin E which helps to fight free radicals in the skin and prevent dry skin conditions.</p>
<p>Sodium Bicarbonate</p>
<p>An active ingredient in <strong>odour control</strong>. Both antibacterial and absorbent, it is powerful and simply the best at keeping odour at bay all day long. We use in as low levels as we can to provide <strong>maximum effectiveness</strong> as occasionally some find sodium bicarbonate to be a skin irritant.</p>
<p>Arrowroot Powder</p>
<p>An edible flour in a similar form to potato flour. It gives our deodorant&nbsp;a <strong>creamier texture</strong> that is <strong>easier to apply</strong> to the skin. You don’t get much safer than edible!</p>
<p>Natural Fragrance</p>
<div>
<p>Our natural deodorants are fragranced with <strong>essential oils</strong> ONLY.&nbsp; The whole oil is used which provides a <strong>light and pleasant fragrance</strong>, not too overpowering. The essential oils each have their own <strong>health benefits</strong> as well as keeping you fresh. For instance, lavender will have a calming effect. Citrus will be more uplifting.</p>
<p>All of these natural ingredients are packaged together to make a truly effective natural deodorant.</p>
