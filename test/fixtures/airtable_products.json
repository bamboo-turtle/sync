In three short decades, we estimate over 2 trillion of them have ended up in landfill – oh, in case you’re wondering, that’s 2,000,000,000,000.\r\nThe average lifespan of a single-use cup is 13 minutes – and due to their plastic content less than 1% get recycled.\r\nSo, in what could only be described as the understatement of the century, we felt there was an appetite for change! We passionately maintain that recycling is not the answer; instead, we can only institute real change with your help. In this enlightened era, there really is no excuse for single-use. That’s why we created Ecoffee Cup.","long_description":"Ecoffee Cup is a new generation of reusable takeaway cup. Created with the world’s fastest growing, most sustainable crop – bamboo fibre, Ecoffee Cup is BPA and phthalate free. If you haven’t experienced Ecoffee Cup, it feels a bit like thick, yet super-light cardboard; hard to believe it can hold hot liquids.\r\nAnd because bamboo fibre is naturally sterile, Ecoffee Cup is lovely to drink from and won’t flavour-taint your drinks. The lid and sleeve are made with matte food-grade silicone which is designed especially for hot liquids.\r\nIt has a re-sealable no-drip lid, making it perfect to take with you everywhere you go. The whole product (cup, lid and sleeve) is dishwasher safe and should last for years if you treat it nicely; of course it can break if you treat it roughly and it is not suitable for microwave use.\r\nAvailable in a wide range of fun, contemporary patterns; bright, vibrant colours or classic prints – there’s one to suit your style, wardrobe or mood. That’s why we think Ecoffee Cup packs just a little bit more style than its plastic, ceramic or stainless steel cousins.\r\nEcoffee Cup. Have Fun.
